        <p class="h4 text-primary"> What's Ethical Photography</p>
        <hr>
        <p>Respect for your subjects and the communities you are documenting should always be your first consideration when you are behind the lens. For more specific guidance on culturally sensitive photography, consider the following questions and directions:</p>
        <li><b class="h5 text-primary">Research and Reflect</b>
            <ul></ul>
            <ul><p></p>Research the people and places you’ll be visiting before traveling — and certainly before taking a photograph.</ul>
            <ul>Give deep consideration to the emotional, psychological, political, economic, cultural, social or physical circumstances of your subject before taking a photograph. Ask yourself, could my photo harm the person or people in it in any way?</ul>
            <ul>Ask yourself if you would be comfortable taking the same picture in your own community. If you answer “yes,” remember that this is just a minimum threshold for deciding whether or not to photograph — in most cases, you will not be considered a member of the community that you are photographing.</ul>
        </li>
        <li><b class="h5 text-primary">Request Consent</b>
            <ul></ul>
            <ul>Always ask for consent before taking a photo, whether through gestures or the native language. If you don’t receive consent, don’t take the photo. If at any point a participant decides they don’t want their photograph taken or used, respect their wishes.</ul>
            <ul>Consider your own circumstances and how those shape your relationship to the subject. Could your nationality, economic status or physical ability, for instance, make it uncomfortable or difficult for the subject to refuse permission for photography or make them feel vulnerable with you behind the lens? If such power differences exist, it may be best to refrain from photographing until you’ve developed a relationship that establishes sufficient trust for both parties to communicate their expectations.</ul>
            <ul>Don’t attempt to hide your camera or the fact that you are taking a picture.</ul>
